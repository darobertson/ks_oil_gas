# Kansas Oil &amp; Gas Data Downloader 

ks_oil_gas.R is an R script to download and combine annual data for Kansas oil and gas production and well counts from the Kansas Geological Survey at http://www.kgs.ku.edu/PRS/petro/state.html

The downloaded data files are saved locally and output is saved in a data frame and csv file in long format for ease of plotting in R. The script requires XLConnect, dplyr, tidyr and stringr.
